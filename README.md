## Getting Started

### Using Docker (Recommended)
Follow the steps below to launch the docker container:

```shell
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```
* Navigate to http://localhost:5000 once the container starts to launch UI.
* APIs are accessible at http://localhost:8080
* Swagger Docs:http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/api-docs/swagger-config#/

## Database Requirements

* The default persistence used is Redis
* The indexing backend is [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (7.x)

## Configuration for various database backends

| Backend        | Configuration                                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redis + ES7    | [config-redis.properties](docker/server/config/config-redis.properties)               |
| Postgres       | [config-postgres.properties](docker/server/config/config-postgres.properties)         |
| Postgres + ES7 | [config-postgres-es7.properties](docker/server/config/config-postgres-es7.properties) |
| MySQL + ES7    | [config-mysql.properties](docker/server/config/config-mysql.properties)               |

## Other Requirements
* JDK 17+
* UI requires Node 14 to build. Earlier Node versions may work but are untested.

###  Building From Source
If you wish to build your own distribution, you can run ```./gradlew build``` from this project that products the runtime artifacts.
The runnable server is in server/ module.
